  title: "Composite Monocoque",
  description:
    "The composite monocoque is the central structural chassis of the Formula SAE car, built using carbon-fiber reinforced polymer with a lightweight core material. Unlike a traditional spaceframe, the monocoque integrates the driverâ€™s cockpit, suspension mounting points, and safety cell into a single shell. This design provides high torsional rigidity, reduced overall weight, and improved driver safety, while also allowing tighter packaging of components and enhanced aerodynamic efficiency.",

  contributions:
    "My contributions focused on optimizing the laminate schedule and ply orientation to achieve the required stiffness-to-mass ratio, performing CAD surfacing to package the cockpit and bulkheads, and running FEA simulations to validate torsional stiffness. I assisted in the manufacturing stage with mold preparation, layup, and curing processes, and ensured compliance with FSAE safety standards such as firewall integrity, anti-intrusion zones, and harness mounting points. Through this work, I helped deliver a lightweight, reliable, and safe chassis that improved overall vehicle performance.",
